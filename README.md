## Bluetooth Headset Control for OS X
Finally take back control of your Bluetooth headset's media keys!

If you have a pair of Bluetooth headphones and use a music program other
than iTunes, you're probably fed up with iTunes launching when you
connect and when you press any of the media buttons. This hack allows you
to *bipass* the default iTunes controls and utilize the media buttons
on your headset as if they were the standard media keys on your keyboard.
This allows you to control playing, pausing, and skipping tracks in
programs such as Spotify, VLC, and many more!
